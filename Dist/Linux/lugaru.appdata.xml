 <description>
  <p>
     Lugaru (pronounced Loo-GAH-roo) is a cross-platform third-person action game. 
     The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit with impressive combat skills.
  </p>

  <p>
     In his quest to find those responsible for slaughtering his village, 
     he uncovers a far-reaching conspiracy involving the corrupt leaders
     of the rabbit republic and the starving wolves from a nearby den. 
     Turner takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and save 
     his fellow rabbits from slavery.
